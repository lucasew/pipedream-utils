Utilities and helper functions for [pipedream](https://pipedream.com)

# Warning

This is not a official pipedream project but a thing that started to have better tested code to be reutilized across pipedream cloud functions.

You are free to use them elsewhere.

The objective is to have fully tested as pure as possible utility functions.
